# basic-file-upload-service

This is a basic file upload service built with a vanilla http NodeJS server.

This is useful in understanding how file uploads work by breaking into pieces and then sending them over the network to be reconstructed and saved on the server-side.

This was built using [@hnasr's](https://github.com/hnasr) video as a reference and following along. The link to the video is [here](https://youtu.be/Ix-c2X7dlks).
